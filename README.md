Waste Management using CNN Model
Project Overview
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying waste images into two primary categories: 'Organic' and 'Recyclable'. The goal is to automate and improve waste segregation processes, contributing to more efficient waste management and environmental sustainability.

Features
Image Classification: Accurately classifies waste images into 'Organic' (O) and 'Recyclable' (R) categories.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a custom CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras for robust image recognition.

Large Dataset Handling: Capable of processing and training on substantial image datasets.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance based on validation accuracy during training.

Prediction Functionality: Includes a function to predict the category of new, unseen waste images.

Technologies Used
Languages: Python

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

opencv-python (cv2)

tqdm

tensorflow (Keras API)

Tools:

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for development and GPU utilization)

KaggleHub (for dataset download)

Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on the "Waste Classification Data" dataset from Kaggle.

Source: Waste Classification Data on Kaggle

Total Images: 22,564 images

Categories:

Organic (O): 12,565 images

Recyclable (R): 9,999 images

Size: Approximately 450 MB (as indicated in the code comments)

Model Architecture (CNN)
The CNN model is built using Sequential API from Keras and consists of:

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D): Extracts features from images (32, 64, 128 filters with 3x3 kernel).

Activation Layers (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity.

Max Pooling Layers (MaxPooling2D): Reduces spatial dimensions and computational complexity.

Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for classification (256, 64 neurons).

Dropout Layers: Prevents overfitting (with a rate of 0.5).

Output Layer: A Dense layer with 2 neurons (for 2 classes) and a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

The model is compiled with binary_crossentropy loss and adam optimizer, with accuracy as the primary metric.

Performance
The model achieved a high validation accuracy:

Validation Accuracy: 89.85% (after 10 epochs)
