# ‚ôªÔ∏è Waste Management using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

This project focuses on classifying waste images into 'Organic' and 'Recyclable' using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. It uses image data from Kaggle with 22,564 labeled images and achieves nearly 90% validation accuracy. The dataset is loaded using OpenCV and preprocessed for training and validation. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, ReLU activation, max pooling, dropout to avoid overfitting, and a sigmoid output for binary classification. Key libraries include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, cv2, tqdm, and TensorFlow.
